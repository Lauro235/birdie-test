# Calendar Notes

[Calendar library for React](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/react)
[fullCalendar React NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullcalendar/react)

Will this play Nice with TypeScript? Listtle TS logo by library makes me think it will..

1. Install packages

npm install --save \
  @fullcalendar/core \
  @fullcalendar/react \
  @fullcalendar/daygrid
